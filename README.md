# Random Walk
A python program that generates random walks and creates a visualization of the data using Matplotlib.  

## About
A random walk is a path that has no clear direction. Every random walk is different.  
- The green dot represents the starting position for the walk.   
- The red dot represents the ending position for the walk.  
- A color map is used to show the order of the points in the walk. The walk starts at light blue and the points get darker as the walk progresses.

## How to Run
Simply clone this repo and type python rw_visual.py
